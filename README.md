# SimpleJavaScriptProjects
Few simple online apps
The intention of this project is to show some basic apps I've created using JavaScript while learning JavaScript.
You can find here some examples of if-else statements, loops and functions.
As I'm still learning programming I will be adding new mini apps to this repository.
